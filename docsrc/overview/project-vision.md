# Project Vision

Semblance AI aims to craft a digital "semblance" of an individual by post-training a base AI model with user-curated dataâ€”books, films, personal writings, and ethical frameworks. Unlike traditional AI assistants, Semblance AI is deeply personalized, acting as an intellectual sparring partner, creative collaborator, and digital legacy.
