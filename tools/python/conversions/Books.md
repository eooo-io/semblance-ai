# Workflow for Books
1. Convert .epub to .txt (youâ€™re already doing this).
2. Load .txt files into PostgreSQL with metadata.
3. Optionally split content into chunks in PostgreSQL.
4. Exprt to Elasticsearch, either as full texts or chunks, depending on your RAG needs.

This setup balances storage efficiency in PostgreSQL with search performance in Elasticsearch, tailored for RAG applications. Let me know if you need help refining any part!
