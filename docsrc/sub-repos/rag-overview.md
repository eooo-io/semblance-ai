# RAG System Overview

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a core component of Semblance AI that combines information retrieval with generative AI to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- Document ingestion and processing
- Vector-based semantic search
- Context-aware response generation
- Integration with multiple LLM providers
- Real-time retrieval and generation

## Architecture

The RAG system consists of several key components:

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**
   - Document ingestion
   - Text extraction and chunking
   - Vector embedding generation

2. **Search Infrastructure**
   - Vector database integration
   - Hybrid search capabilities
   - Query preprocessing

3. **Generation System**
   - Context assembly
   - Prompt engineering
   - Response generation and post-processing

## Getting Started

For detailed setup and usage instructions, please refer to the [RAG System Documentation](https://github.com/eooo-io/semblance-rag).

## Integration

The RAG system can be integrated with other Semblance AI components through:

- REST API endpoints
- Python SDK
- Docker containers
- Message queue systems
