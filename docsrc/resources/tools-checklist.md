### Notes on Deployment Strategies
- **Local**: Tools designed for personal hardware (e.g., laptop, GPU workstation) to prioritize privacy and cost-efficiency. Ideal for initial prototyping and personal use with your 4GB+ dataset.
- **Cloud**: Scalable, resource-intensive tools for large datasets or training larger models (e.g., 1B parameters). Useful for future scaling but may involve costs and privacy considerations.
- **Hybrid**: Tools that can run locally or in the cloud, offering flexibility. Suitable for transitioning from local experiments to cloud-based scaling or for tools with optional cloud integrations (e.g., Hugging Face).
