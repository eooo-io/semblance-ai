# Welcome to Semblance AI

Semblance AI is an experimental project to create a highly personalized AI model that acts as a digital extension of an individual's knowledge, beliefs, values, and creative essence. Unlike traditional AI assistants trained on broad, web-scraped datasets, Semblance AI empowers users to curate their own training corpus to build a model that mirrors their unique worldview.

## Vision

The core idea is to:

- Start with a robust base model trained on a high-quality, epistemically consistent corpus of human knowledge
- Post-train it using Personal Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG), where users feed in their own data
- Enable the AI to function as an augmentation of the self, capable of tasks like intellectual sparring, creative collaboration, and ethical decision-making

## Project Status

This project is in its early conceptual and experimental phase. Initial work includes:

- Defining the framework for Personal Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG)
- Curating a starter dataset of 4GB of text, with plans to expand to multimodal inputs
- Outlining technical requirements for a small-scale model using tools like Hugging Face or PyTorch

## Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Concept Refinement - Finalize KAG framework and data schema
- **Q3 2025**: Prototype Development - Train small-scale model on curated text data
- **Q4 2025**: Multimodal Expansion - Incorporate images, audio, and other media
- **2026**: Community Experiments - Open-source select components
